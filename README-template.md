## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development


- I plan on learning to use TailwindCSS in my future projects.
- I will most definitely go into depth in Flexbox and Grid in CSS since I have come to discover that there is always more to it than I think I know.
